## Hints

The first task is to run a client’s WebSocket which will connect to 
the server. Then you should “force” the hero to listen to the commands. 
This is the way prepare yourself to the game. The main goal is to 
play meaningfully and win. 

If you are not sure what to do try to implement the following algorithms:

* Move to a random empty adjacent cell.
* Move to a free cell in the direction of the nearest chest.
* Try to hide from future blasts.
* Avoid ghost and other heroes.
* Try to set the bomb so that it explode the box, ghosts or another heroes.
